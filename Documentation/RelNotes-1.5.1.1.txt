GIT v1.5.1.1 Release Notes (draft)
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.1
------------------

* Documentation updates

  - The --left-right option of rev-list and friends is documented.

  - The documentation for cvsimport has been majorly improved.

* Bugfixes

  - "git send-email" produced of References header of unbounded length;
    fixed this with line-folding.

  - "git archive" to download from remote site should not
    require you to be in a git repository, but it incorrectly
    did.

  - "git apply" ignored -p<n> for "diff --git" formatted
    patches.

  - "git rerere" recorded a conflict that had one side empty
    (the other side adds) incorrectly; this made merging in the
    other direction fail to use previously recorded resolution.

  - t4200 test was broken where "wc -l" pads its output with
    spaces.

  - "git branch -m old new" to rename branch did not work
    without a configuration file in ".git/config".

  - The sample hook for notification e-mail was misnamed.

  - gitweb did not show type-changing patch correctly in the
    blobdiff view.
