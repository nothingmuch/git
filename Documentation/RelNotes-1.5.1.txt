GIT v1.5.1 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.5.0
--------------------

* Deprecated commands and options.

  - git-diff-stages and git-resolve have been removed.

* New commands and options.

  - "git log" and friends take --reverse, which instructs them
    to give their output in the order opposite from their usual.
    They typically output from new to old, but with this option
    their output would read from old to new.  "git shortlog"
    usually lists older commits first, but with this option,
    they are shown from new to old.

  - "git log --pretty=format:<string>" to allow more flexible
    custom log output.

  - "git diff" learned --ignore-space-at-eol.  This is a weaker
    form of --ignore-space-change.

  - "git diff --no-index pathA pathB" can be used as diff
    replacement with git specific enhancements.

  - "git diff --no-index" can read from '-' (standard input).

  - "git diff" also learned --exit-code to exit with non-zero
    status when it found differences.  In the future we might
    want to make this the default but that would be a rather big
    backward incompatible change; it will stay as an option for
    now.

  - "git diff --quiet" is --exit-code with output turned off,
    meant for scripted use to quickly determine if there is any
    tree-level difference.

  - Textual patch generation with "git diff" without -w/-b
    option has been significantly optimized.  "git blame" got
    faster because of the same change.

  - "git log" and "git rev-list" has been optimized
    significantly when they are used with pathspecs.

  - "git branch --track" can be used to set up configuration
    variables to help it easier to base your work on branches
    you track from a remote site.

  - "git format-patch --attach" now emits attachments.  Use
    --inline to get an inlined multipart/mixed.

  - "git name-rev" learned --refs=<pattern>, to limit the tags
    used for naming the given revisions only to the ones
    matching the given pattern.

  - "git remote update" is to run "git fetch" for defined remotes
    to update tracking branches.

  - "git cvsimport" can now take '-d' to talk with a CVS
    repository different from what are recorded in CVS/Root
    (overriding it with environment CVSROOT does not work).

  - "git bundle" can help sneaker-netting your changes between
    repositories.

  - "git mergetool" can help 3-way file-level conflict
    resolution with your favorite graphical merge tools.

  - A new configuration "core.symlinks" can be used to disable
    symlinks on filesystems that do not support them; they are
    checked out as regular files instead.

  - You can name a commit object with its first line of the
    message.  The syntax to use is ':/message text'.  E.g.

    $ git show ":/object name: introduce ':/<oneline prefix>' notation"

    means the same thing as:

    $ git show 28a4d940443806412effa246ecc7768a21553ec7

  - "git bisect" learned a new command "run" that takes a script
    to run after each revision is checked out to determine if it
    is good or bad, to automate the bisection process.

  - "git log" family learned a new traversal option --first-parent,
    which does what the name suggests.


* Updated behaviour of existing commands.

  - "git fsck" does not barf on corrupt loose objects.

  - "git rm" does not remove newly added files without -f.

  - "git archimport" allows remapping when coming up with git
    branch names from arch names.

  - git-svn got almost a rewrite.

  - core.autocrlf configuration, when set to 'true', makes git
    to convert CRLF at the end of lines in text files to LF when
    reading from the filesystem, and convert in reverse when
    writing to the filesystem.  The variable can be set to
    'input', in which case the conversion happens only while
    reading from the filesystem but files are written out with
    LF at the end of lines.  Currently, which paths to consider
    'text' (i.e. be subjected to the autocrlf mechanism) is
    decided purely based on the contents, but the plan is to
    allow users to explicitly override this heuristic based on
    paths.

  - The behaviour of 'git-apply', when run in a subdirectory,
    without --index nor --cached were inconsistent with that of
    the command with these options.  This was fixed to match the
    behaviour with --index.  A patch that is meant to be applied
    with -p1 from the toplevel of the project tree can be
    applied with any custom -p<n> option.  A patch that is not
    relative to the toplevel needs to be applied with -p<n>
    option with or without --index (or --cached).

  - "git diff" outputs a trailing HT when pathnames have embedded
    SP on +++/--- header lines, in order to help "GNU patch" to
    parse its output.  "git apply" was already updated to accept
    this modified output format since ce74618d (Sep 22, 2006).

  - "git cvsserver" runs hooks/update and honors its exit status.

  - "git cvsserver" can be told to send everything with -kb.

  - "git diff --check" also honors the --color output option.

  - "git name-rev" used to stress the fact that a ref is a tag too
    much, by saying something like "v1.2.3^0~22".  It now says
    "v1.2.3~22" in such a case (it still says "v1.2.3^0" if it does
    not talk about an ancestor of the commit that is tagged, which
    makes sense).

  - "git rev-list --boundary" now shows boundary markers for the
    commits omitted by --max-age and --max-count condition.

  - The configuration mechanism now reads $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig.

  - "git apply --verbose" shows what preimage lines were wanted
    when it couldn't find them.

  - "git status" in a read-only repository got a bit saner.

  - "git fetch" (hence "git clone" and "git pull") are less
    noisy when the output does not go to tty.

  - "git fetch" between repositories with many refs were slow
    even when there are not many changes that needed
    transferring.  This has been sped up by partially rewriting
    the heaviest parts in C.

  - "git mailinfo" which splits an e-mail into a patch and the
    metainformation was rewritten, thanks to Don Zickus.  It
    handles nested multipart better.

  - send-email learned configurable bcc and chain-reply-to.

  - "git remote show $remote" also talks about branches that
    would be pushed if you run "git push remote".

  - Using objects from packs is now seriouly optimized by clever
    use of a cache.  This should be most noticeable in git-log
    family of commands that involve reading many tree objects.
    In addition, traversing revisions while filtering changes
    with pathspecs is made faster by terminating the comparison
    between the trees as early as possible.


* Hooks

  - The part to send out notification e-mails was removed from
    the sample update hook, as it was not an appropriate place
    to do so.


* Others

  - git-revert, git-gc and git-cherry-pick are now built-ins.
