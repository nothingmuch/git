GIT v1.5.1 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.5.0
--------------------

* Deprecated commands and options.

  - git-diff-stages and git-resolve have been removed.

* New commands and options.

  - "git log" and friends take --reverse.  This makes output
    that typically goes reverse order in chronological order.
    "git shortlog" usually lists commits in chronological order,
    but with "--reverse", they are shown in reverse
    chronological order.

  - "git diff" learned --ignore-space-at-eol.  This is a weaker
    form of --ignore-space-change.

* Updated behaviour of existing commands.

 - "git diff" outputs a trailing HT when pathnames have embedded
   SP on +++/--- header lines, in order to help "GNU patch" to
   parse its output.  "git apply" was already updated to accept
   this modified output format since ce74618d (Sep 22, 2006).

* Hooks

 - The sample update hook to show how to send out notification
   e-mail was updated to show only new commits that appeared in
   the repository.  Earlier, it showed new commits that appeared
   on the branch.
