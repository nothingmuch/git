git-mktag(1)
============

NAME
----
git-mktag - Creates a tag object


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git-mktag' < tag_data_file


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads tag object data on standard input and creates a tag object
that can also be used to sign other objects.

The output is the new tag's <object> identifier.


DISCUSSION
----------
Tag object data has the following format

[verse]
  object <sha1>
  type <typename>
  tag <tagname>               (optional)
  keywords <keywords>         (optional)
  tagger <committer>

followed by a blank line and a free-form message and an optional signature
that git itself doesn't care about, but that may be verified with gpg or
similar.

In the above listing, `<sha1>` represents the object pointed to by this tag,
`<typename>` is the type of the object pointed to ("tag", "blob", "tree" or
"commit"), `<tagname>` is the name of this tag object (and must correspond
to the name of the corresponding ref (if any) in `.git/refs/`). `<keywords>`
is a comma-separated list of keywords associated with this tag object, and
`<committer>` holds the "`name <email>`" of the tag creator and timestamp
of when the tag object was created (analogous to "committer" in commit
objects).

If "`tag <tagname>`" is omitted, <tagname> defaults to the empty string.
If "`keywords <keywords>`" is omitted, <keywords> defaults to "`tag`" if
a <tagname> was given, "`note`" otherwise.
