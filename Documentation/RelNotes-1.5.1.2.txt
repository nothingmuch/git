GIT v1.5.1.2 Release Notes (draft)
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.1.1
--------------------

* Bugfixes

  - "git diff a/ b/" incorrectly fell in "diff between two
    filesystem objects" codepath, when the user most likely
    wanted to limit the extent of output to two tracked
    directories.

  - git-quiltimport had the same bug as we fixed for
    git-applymbox in v1.5.1.1 -- it gave an alarming "did not
    have any patch" message (but did not actually fail and was
    harmless).

  - various git-svn fixes.

  - Sample update hook incorrectly always refused requests to
    delete branches through push.

  - git-blame on a very long working tree path had buffer
    overrun problem.

* Documentation updates

  - Various documentation updates from J. Bruce Fields, Frank
    Lichtenheld, Alex Riesen and others.  Andrew Ruder started a
    war on undocumented options.
