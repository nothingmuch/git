GIT v1.5.2 Release Notes (draft)
========================

Updates since v1.5.1
--------------------

* New commands and options.

  - "git bisect start" can optionally take a single bad commit and
    zero or more good commits on the command line.

  - "git shortlog" can optionally be told to wrap its output.

  - "subtree" merge strategy allows another project to be merged in as
    your subdirectory.

  - "git format-patch" learned a new --subject-prefix=<string>
    option, to override the built-in "[PATCH]".

* Updated behavior of existing commands.

  - "git diff --stat" shows size of preimage and postimage blobs
    for binary contents.  Earlier it only said "Bin".

  - "git lost-found" shows stuff that are unreachable except
    from reflogs.

  - "git checkout branch^0" now detaches HEAD at the tip commit
    on the named branch, instead of just switching to the
    branch (use "git checkout branch" to switch to the branch,
    as before).

  - "git bisect next" can be used after giving only a bad commit
    without giving a good one (this starts bisection half-way to
    the root commit).  We used to refuse to operate without a
    good and a bad commit.

  - "git push", when pushing into more than one repository, does
    not stop at the first error.

  - "git archive" does not insist you to give --format parameter
    anymore; it defaults to "tar".

* Builds

  - git-p4import has never been installed; now there is an
    installation option to do so.

  - gitk and git-gui can be configured out.

  - Generated documentation pages automatically get version
    information from GIT_VERSION

  - Parallel build with "make -j" descending into subdirectory
    was fixed.

* Performance Tweaks

  - optimized "git-rev-list --bisect" (hence "git-bisect").

  - optimized "git-add $path" in a large directory, most of
    whose contents are ignored.


Fixes since v1.5.1
------------------

The following are all in v1.5.1.x series, unless otherwise noted.

* Documentation updates

  - Various documentation updates from J. Bruce Fields, Frank
    Lichtenheld, Alex Riesen and others.  Andrew Ruder started a
    war on undocumented options.

* Bugfixes

  - "git diff a/ b/" incorrectly fell in "diff between two
    filesystem objects" codepath, when the user most likely
    wanted to limit the extent of output to two tracked
    directories.

  - git-quiltimport had the same bug as we fixed for
    git-applymbox in v1.5.1.1 -- it gave an alarming "did not
    have any patch" message (but did not actually fail and was
    harmless).

  - various git-svn fixes.

  - Sample update hook incorrectly always refused requests to
    delete branches through push.

  - git-blame on a very long working tree path had buffer
    overrun problem.

  - Switching branches with "git checkout" refused to work when
    a path changes from a file to a directory between the
    current branch and the new branch, in order not to lose
    possible local changes in the directory that is being turned
    into a file with the switch.  We now allow such a branch
    switch after making sure that there is no locally modified
    file nor un-ignored file in the directory.  This has not
    been backported to 1.5.1.x series, as it is rather an
    intrusive change.

  - Merging branches that have a file in one and a directory in
    another at the same path used to get quite confused.  We
    handle such a case a bit more carefully, even though that is
    still left as a conflict for the user to sort out.  This
    will not be backported to 1.5.1.x series, as it is rather an
    intrusive change.
