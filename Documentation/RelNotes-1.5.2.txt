GIT v1.5.2 Release Notes (draft)
========================

Updates since v1.5.1
--------------------

* New commands and options.

  - "git bisect start" can optionally take a single bad commit and
    zero or more good commits on the command line.

* Updated behavior of existing commands.

  - "git diff --stat" shows size of preimage and postimage blobs
    for binary contents.  Earlier it only said "Bin".

  - "git lost-found" shows stuff that are unreachable except
    from reflogs.

  - "git checkout branch^0" now detaches HEAD at the tip commit
    on the named branch, instead of just switching to the
    branch (use "git checkout branch" to switch to the branch,
    as before).

  - "git bisect next" can be used after giving only a bad commit
    without giving a good one (this starts bisection half-way to
    the root commit).  We used to refuse to operate without a
    good and a bad commit.

* Builds

  - git-p4import has never been installed; now there is an
    installation option to do so.

  - gitk and git-gui can be configured out.

  - Generated documentation pages automatically get version
    information from GIT_VERSION

  - Parallel build with "make -j" descending into subdirectory
    was fixed.

* Performance Tweaks

  - optimized "git-rev-list --bisect" (hence "git-bisect").

  - optimized "git-add $path" in a large directory, most of
    whose contents are ignored.


Fixes since v1.5.1
------------------

The following are all in v1.5.1.x series, unless otherwise noted.

* Documentation updates

* Bugfixes

  - Switching branches with "git checkout" refused to work when
    a path changes from a file to a directory between the
    current branch and the new branch, in order not to lose
    possible local changes in the directory that is being turned
    into a file with the switch.  We now allow such a branch
    switch after making sure that there is no locally modified
    file nor un-ignored file in the directory.  This has not
    been backported to 1.5.1.x series, as it is rather an
    intrusive change.

* Performance Tweaks
