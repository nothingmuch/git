GIT v1.5.0.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.0
------------------

* Documentation updates

  - Clarifications and corrections to 1.5.0 release notes.

  - The main documentation did not link to git-remote documentation.

  - Clarified introductory text of git-rebase documentation.

  - Converted remaining mentions of update-index on Porcelain
    documents to git-add/git-rm.

* Bugfixes

  - git-daemon marks the listening sockets with FD_CLOEXEC so
    that it won't be leaked into the children.

  - segfault from git-blame when the mandatory pathname
    parameter was missing was fixed; usage() message is given
    instead.

* Tweaks

  - sliding mmap() inefficiently mmaped the same region of a
    packfile with an access pattern that used objects in the
    reverse order.  This has been made more efficient.
